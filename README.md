BlueBox 🟦
</h1>

<p align="center">
In order to test autonomous routines on mobile robotic systems, receiving feedback during runtime is extremely important. BlueBox is an app designed to be installed on an SBC such as a Raspberry Pi to relay and present debug data from a serial port (such as a VEX V5 brain) to a developer over Wi-Fi.
